# Company Feature Requirements

## Purpose

Provide a Codex-ready requirements workflow.

## Workflow

1. Establish context with `company-context-index`.
2. Clarify goal, users, in-scope behavior, out-of-scope behavior, dependencies, and risks.
3. Use `company-expert-routing` when the requirement is non-trivial; let it select the matching bundle automatically from `BUNDLES.md`.
4. Use `brainstorming` when the idea has multiple plausible directions or the user is still exploring options.
5. Write Given-When-Then acceptance criteria.
6. Stop after requirements unless the user explicitly gives the design handoff signal.

## Artifact

When a requirements template is needed, resolve it in this order:

1. Project copy: `specs/global/assets/requirements-template.md`.
2. Plugin fallback: read `../../specs/global/assets/requirements-template.md` relative to this skill directory.

Save small work under `specs/features/<feature>/requirements.md`. If the user explicitly wants lightweight solution exploration, do not force a full requirements document; provide goals, options, risks, open questions, and next-step recommendations.

## Boundary

Requirements work must not modify implementation code or prescribe low-level architecture.
