# Company Implementation Runner

## Purpose

Provide a Codex orchestration skill that reuses Superpowers TDD and verification instead of duplicating them.

## Workflow

1. Confirm requirements, design, and task plan exist unless this is `/hotfix` or `/spike`; if the task involves `business-rules.md`, read it.
2. Identify the next task and its verification.
3. Explicitly use `superpowers:test-driven-development`; define the minimal failing case or verification anchor before implementation.
4. Use `company-expert-routing` when implementation depends on framework internals, typing, performance, concurrency, data modeling, or UI craft; keep the bundle from design unless the touched area changed.
5. Make scoped edits.
6. Before claiming completion, run adversarial review for the relevant extreme input, abnormal state, permission, concurrency, performance, or UI rendering risks.
7. Explicitly use `superpowers:verification-before-completion` before claiming completion.
8. Choose validation level `V0/V1/V2/V3` automatically and gather sufficient but not excessive evidence.
9. Check documentation drift: whether implementation changed requirements, business rules, technical design, API contracts, task plans, project entry docs, or indexes.
10. Run verification; when the company project uses progress documents, update according to branch strategy: integration branches may update public entry documents, business branches write `docs/public-doc-updates/<branch-or-feature>.md`.

## Superpowers Layer

- Default: `superpowers:test-driven-development` + `superpowers:verification-before-completion`.
- With a test harness: write or identify the failing test first, confirm the failure, then implement the smallest passing change.
- Without a test harness: define the minimal reproduction, input/output sample, page path, screenshot check, or manual verification checklist first.
- For pure copy, comment, or no-behavior edits, TDD may be skipped, but completion verification still applies and the reason must be stated.

## Validation Levels

- `V0`: docs, comments, formatting, or no-behavior changes; a diff and target-file review are enough.
- `V1`: isolated low-risk changes; run a focused command, local test, or minimal manual path.
- `V2`: default feature implementation; run related tests, type/build checks, and browser/manual verification when needed.
- `V3`: production, permission, security, data, performance, money/metric formulas, cross-system work, or hotfix; run regression, adversarial cases, and rollback/recovery notes.

Do not downgrade V2/V3 to save time, and do not force full verification for V0/V1 small changes.

## Boundary

Do not implement tasks that are not in the approved plan unless the user explicitly approves scope expansion.

If implementation reveals missing operation logic, formulas, field semantics, state transitions, or exception handling, do not guess; stop implementation and route back to `company-feature-requirements` to complete `business-rules.md`.

Non-integration branches must not write unmerged results directly into the current-state section of `说明文档.md`; record public entry changes as a public-doc update patch.

If implementation changes a documented promise but docs are not synchronized, the completion report must state `Documentation drift impact` and mark whether it was fixed, needs user confirmation, or should be handled by a later public-document patch.
